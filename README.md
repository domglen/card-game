Modelling a 2-player card game in HTML/Javascript  
This is some code I wrote to help with developing a 2-player card game. Note that this does not 'play' a game - it takes no account of the rules - it only lets a developer model a game, thus avoiding the need to go to physical cards early on in the development.  
The code takes two decks of cards, in Images/Deck1 and /Deck2, and deals a hand of 12 cards to each player. Both players' hands are revealed on the page, allowing full modelling of the game. Clicking on a card will 'play' it - ie remove it from the hand. Clicking on the + for each player will add a new card to that player's hand. The last card played for each player is displayed separately in case that helps with keeping track of the state of the game.
